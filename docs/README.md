# Project Documentation Index

This folder centralizes documentation for the TikTok Clone repository.

- docs/backend/ - Backend-specific documentation (build summaries, API docs, implementation notes)
  - `docs/backend/FINAL_BUILD_SUMMARY.md` - Complete backend build summary
  - `docs/backend/API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - API reference (Identity, Video, Interaction, User)

- docs/gateway/ - API Gateway documentation
  - `docs/gateway/API_GATEWAY_README.md` - Ocelot gateway config and routes

- docs/frontend/ - Frontend documentation (nextjs, conventions, env)
  - (to be filled)

- devops/ - DevOps & deployment artifacts
  - `devops/README.md` - Guidance and pointer to `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

Notes:
- Originals in `BackEnd/` and `FrontEnd/` are preserved. Files in `docs/` are copies for easier discovery and navigation.
- If you'd like, I can move additional docs into `docs/` or create a navigation index page with short excerpts.

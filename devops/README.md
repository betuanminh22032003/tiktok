# DevOps & Deployment

This folder collects deployment instructions, CI/CD notes, and operational runbooks.

Current guidance:
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` (root) — Primary deployment guide (created by assistant, later edited by user). Do not overwrite without confirmation.

Suggested next steps:
- Move the finalized `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` into this folder as `devops/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` after reconciling any manual edits.
- Add container hosting notes, production `docker-compose` variants, and Nginx/letsencrypt snippets here.

If you want, I can produce a diff between assistant-generated `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` and the current file so you can approve the final version to move here.
